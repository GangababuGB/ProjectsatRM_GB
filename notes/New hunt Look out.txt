Make sure your reputation is in order. Today’s candidates are looking for more than a regular paycheck. They want a rewarding career that aligns with their lifestyle, 
values, and professional development goals. Focus on building a strong brand that reflects your company values to attract like-minded job hunters.
How do you support workers? Do you have a mentorship program, a learning stipend like Tinder, a rotational program like Stryker? Do you give back to the community? 
Stand up for disadvantaged groups? All of these things are selling points you can use for recruiting top tech talent.
Additionally, take a look at your social profiles, media mentions, and customer reviews. What do people think about your company? 
If you’ve made mistakes in the past, what can you do to fix them?
Finally, you might try amplifying your efforts by creating employee referral or brand ambassador programs that show off your culture from the employee point of view.

How to Retain Software Developers & Engineers
One of the pillars of 3Pillar’s culture comes from Daniel Pink’s Drive. Specifically, it leans on his theory on human motivation. 
The idea is intrinsic motivation consists of three key elements: autonomy, mastery, and purpose.
Assuming people are compensated fairly for their work, these three factors create the ideal conditions for productive work.
Here are some examples of how that concept might play out on the job.
Great leadership is crucial. Retaining top developers and engineers starts with making sure that you have a great leadership team. 
Poor leaders will cause employees to “quit the manager” instead of the company or the job. Over time, former employees will spread the word to their network.
While “bad leaders” come in all shapes and sizes, you can usually spot one based on the following three “failures:”

They don’t stand up for their team.
They miss potential disruptions early in the process.
They fail to strategize effectively and respond to issues appropriately.
The leadership team is responsible for nurturing autonomy, mastery, and purpose. Here leaders create a safe, supportive space where workers are encouraged to 
take ownership of tasks, explore new skills, solve problems, and ask each other for help.

Create a culture that nurtures learning. Provide training and resources that allow employees to refine existing skills and master new ones.
Keep in mind, mastery takes more than reading books and watching videos–it should support those engineers who have achieved a certain level of maturity in a new area, 
providing an opportunity to teach others, or start working toward a specialized role.

Offer a career path. No one wants to stay in the same role forever. People want to move up, tackle new challenges, and change their surroundings.

That said, companies aren’t schools. Employers might consider offering opportunities for growth and specialization in a team setting. 
That way, companies can upskill multiple workers at a time and measure the direct impact of those initiatives against strategic goals.
